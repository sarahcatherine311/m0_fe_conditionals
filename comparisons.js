// -------------------
// PART 1: Comparing variables
// -------------------

var numberTeachers = 4
var numberStudents = 20
var stringTeachers = "4"
var numberDogs = 0

// EXAMPLE: log the result of the comparison: is numberTeachers greater than numberStudents?
console.log("Is numberTeachers greater than numberStudents?", numberTeachers > numberStudents);
// this should log: "Is numberTeachers greater than numberStudents?" false

// YOU DO: log the result of the comparison: is numberTeachers less than numberStudents?
// this should log: true
console.log("Is numberTeachers less than numberStudents?", numberTeachers < numberStudents);

// YOU DO: log the result of the comparison: is numberTeachers strictly equal to stringTeachers?
// this should log: false
console.log("Is numberTeachers strictly equal to stringTeachers?", numberTeachers === stringTeachers);

// YOU DO: log the result of the comparison: is numberTeachers not equal to numberStudents?
// this should log: true
console.log("Is numberTeachers not equal to numberStudents?", numberTeachers !== numberStudents);

// YOU DO: log the result of the comparison: is numberStudents greater than or equal to 20?
// this should log: true
console.log("Is numberStudents greater than or equal to 20?", numberStudents >= 20);

// YOU DO: log the result of the comparison: is numberStudents greater than or equal to 21?
// this should log: false
console.log("Is numberStudents greater than or equal to 21?", numberStudents >= 21);

// YOU DO: log the result of the comparison: is numberStudents less than or equal to 20?
// this should log: true
console.log("Is numberStudents less than or equal to 20?", numberStudents <= 20);

// YOU DO: log the result of the comparison: is numberStudents less than or equal to 21?
// this should log: true
console.log("Is numberStudents less than or equal to 21?", numberStudents <= 21);


// #-------------------
// PART 2: Articulating what you are doing
// #-------------------

// For the following prompts, you will be given a line of code and your task is to type out a Comment,
// in English, explaining what that line of code is doing, including what the comparison will evaluate to.
// Be as technically precise as possible, but don't just copy and paste a definition from the readings.
// Make sure YOU can explain it that way!

console.log(4 < 9);
// YOU DO: Explain.
// This is asking if the number 4 is less than the number 9. It will evaluate to: true

var books = 3;
console.log(4 < books);
// YOU DO: Explain.
// The first line of code is assigning the variable books to the number 3.
// The second line of code is asking if the number 4 is less than the variable books. This will evaluate to 
// false as the value of books is 3. 

var friends = 6;
var siblings = 2;
console.log(friends > siblings);
// YOU DO: Explain.
// The first line of code is assigning the variable friends to the number 6. 
// The second line of code is assigning the variable siblings to the number 2.
// The third line of code is asking if the variable friends is greater than the variable siblings. This will
// evaluate to: true

var attendees = 9;
var meals = 8;
console.log(attendees !== meals);
// YOU DO: Explain.
// The first line of code is assigning the variable attendees to the number 9.
// The second line of code is assigning the variable meals to the number 8.
// The third line of code is asking if the variable attendees is not equal to the variable meals. This will
// evaluate to true as they are not equal.

// #-------------------
// PART 3: Logical Operators
// #-------------------

var isHungry = true;
var finishedHomework = false;

// EXAMPLE:
// Determine if the user is hungry and has completed their homework
console.log(isHungry && finishedHomework);
// Determine if the user is hungry or has completed their homework
console.log(isHungry || finishedHomework);

var lovesToPlay = true;
var lovesDogPark = false;
var lovesTreats = true;
var age = 1;

// YOU DO:
// Determine if the dog loves to play and loves treats
console.log(lovesToPlay && lovesTreats);

// Determine if the dog loves to play and loves the dog park
console.log(lovesToPlay && lovesDogPark);

// Determine if the dog loves to play or loves the dog park
console.log(lovesToPlay || lovesDogPark)

// Determine if the dog loves to play and is a puppy
console.log(lovesToPlay && isPuppy);

// What did your final line of code evaluate to? Why do you think that is? Explain.
// ANSWER: The final line of code evaluates to an error because there is no defined variable for isPuppy.
// Without a definition for what age constitutes the age of a puppy, we cannot code the correct answer.
